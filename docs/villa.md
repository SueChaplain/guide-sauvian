# About the villa


## Keys 

The house keys are colour coded for convenience: 

- Front door - red 
- Gate - black 
- Garage - orange

Please ensure that the villa is locked when you go out and that you lock the gate behind
you.

## Internet access

The wifi network for the villa is called **Livebox-A58C**.

Use the following security key: **Z9bC pAhm v6Y9 XU5ffe**

(Enter with no spaces and upper case alphas)

## Pool

The pool is 1.3 metres at the shallow end and 1.7 metres at the deep end. Do not dive.

A pool security fence is provided that complies with French law and allows you to manage the safety of your party. The fence consists of 3 metre panels that are connected with secure clips. Unclip a section and remove a pole to create an opening for access. If the fence is removed it must be stored in the container provided.  


*The pool is equipped with a pool alarm to comply with French law and to help you monitor
the safety of your party. It is not a substitute for careful vigilance. Water displacement,
such as occurs when an object breaks the surface, automatically triggers the alarm.
Deactivate the alarm sensor when you want to use the pool and can safely supervise all
members of your party. The alarm sensor should remain active at all other times.*

*To deactivate the sensor, enter the following passcode on the keypad: 1234
The sensor automatically reactivates when the pool has been vacated for approximately
10 minutes.*

*In the event that the pool alarm is activated, a siren will sound. Deactivate the alarm by
pressing any key on the keypad.*

Please read the pool safety fact sheet.

Pool towels are provided for use by guests but must not be taken to the beach.
The pool is cleaned once a week and the pool management company have a key to the
gate for access.

There is a pool net in the garage that you can use to remove leaves or insects that might find
their way into the water between maintenance visits.

**Note:** The pool pump automatically stops when the water level drops below the openings to the skimmer baskets. Although the pool is topped up during maintenance visits, the level can
drop during periods of extreme heat or usage. If you notice a drop in the water level,
please use the outside tap and hose to raise the level up to the midpoint of the skimmer
opening.

## Summer kitchen

The summer kitchen gives you the opportunity to cook al fresco without warming up the
interior of the house. If you use this facility, please clean the BBQ grill and dispose of any ash. 

## Washing and cleaning

The washing machine is located in the utility room at the back of the house, which can be
accessed from the passageway past the summer kitchen or from the green bedroom at the end of the corridor. You can find the key on a hook in the bedroom by the back door.

A free-standing clothes airer is provided for drying small items. For larger items, use the washing lines beneath the car port. These lines are particularly useful for drying or airing your beach towels when you return from the beach.

The ironing board, iron, vacuum cleaner and other cleaning tools or products are typically located in the utility room or under the kitchen sink.

## Bin collections

The **green bin** is for general household waste, which is collected each Wednesday and Saturday. All waste must be in tied bags.

The **black bin** with the yellow lid is for recycling and is collected every 2 weeks on a
Saturday afternoon. You can find the collection calendar (calendrier de collecte) in the printed house notes or simply check to see whether this bin is put out by neighbours. Note
that the recycling bin must not be used for glass, which should be taken to a community bin. (You are likely to pass several dedicated glass bins around the streets of Sauvian.)

Please put the bins outside the front of the property for collection and bring them back in after they have been emptied. 

All bins must be empty on departure and you must dispose of any left-over bags that cannot be collected by using any community bins in the area. For more information about the location of these bins, see [Community bins](localamenities.md#commmunity-bins). 

**Note:** The property management company will charge for any bins that are left unemptied.


## Household appliances

If you have any problems operating any of the household appliances, the instruction
booklets can be found in the bottom drawer of the cabinet in the dining area.

The LG fridge freezer features a water storage tank in the fridge door rather than a mains
water connection. This means that you can choose to fill the tank with tap or mineral water,
which is then used for the cold water, ice, and crushed ice supply.


## Windy days

The Languedoc is the windiest region of France. In the heat of the Summer it is very welcome to take the edge off the heat. However, on very windy days, we can experience a wind tunnel effect through the house if the doors or windows are open at the back and the front of the house  simultaneously. The doors are prone to slam shut, which might cause injury, so please take
care. During high winds, we recommend keeping the back doors and windows closed, and
closing the internal door to the green bedroom before opening the external door to the back of the property.

## Sun shades

An automatic awning is available to shade the outdoor dining table. 

A triangular sail shade is also stored in the garage and can be set up between the car port and external wall to provide additional shade on the terrace. See the picture on the [Welcome page](index.md).

During high winds, please do not use either shade. 

## Fuse box

The fuse box is located in the garage. Spare fuses can be found in the corner cupboard in
the lounge, together with spare light bulbs, should they be needed.

## Bicycles

There are a couple of bicycles in the garage that you are free to use at your own risk to get
about locally. All we ask is that you lock them up when out and about and leave them in
the condition you found them so that our next guests can make use of them too.

## Cot and highchair

If you have asked to use the travel cot, you can find a spare set of linen in the cupboard of the grey bedroom. If you need to use this set during your stay, please launder the ones you change and return these to the cupboard.

A booster seat for small children to use at the table can be found in the cabinet in the dining area. 

## Television

The television is a smart television, with the usual selection of applications such as Netflix. French television channels are available and the Humax box provides access to English television channels.   

Please do not alter the position or angle of the television to avoid excessive stress on the
wall fixings.
