## Pool

The pool is 1.3 metres at the shallow end and 1.7 metres at the deep end. Do not dive.

A pool security fence is provided that complies with French law and allows you to manage the safety of your party. The fence consists of 3 metre panels that are connected with safety hooks. Unhook a section and remove a pole to create an opening for access. Follow these steps: 

- Hold the two poles and put pressure on them to bring them closer together.
- Release the safety latch (the movable piece on one end of the spring).
- Lift up the hook to separate the sections.
- Lift up a pole by turning it. 

Close any access points at the end of the supervised swimming session.

If the fence is removed it must be stored in the container provided and replaced before you leave. 

Please read the pool safety fact sheet that is included with the house notes.

Pool towels are provided for use by guests but must not be taken to the beach.
The pool is cleaned once a week and the pool management company have a key to the
gate for access.

There is a pool net in the garage that you can use to remove leaves or insects that might find
their way into the water between maintenance visits.

**Note:** The pool pump automatically stops when the water level drops below the openings to the skimmer baskets. Although the pool is topped up during maintenance visits, the level can
drop during periods of extreme heat or usage. If you notice a drop in the water level,
please use the outside tap and hose to raise the level up to the midpoint of the skimmer
opening.

## Summer kitchen

The summer kitchen gives you the opportunity to cook al fresco without warming up the
interior of the house. If you use this facility, please clean the BBQ grill and dispose of any ash. 

## Washing and cleaning

The washing machine is located in the utility room at the back of the house, which can be
accessed from the passageway past the summer kitchen or from the green bedroom at the end of the corridor. You can find the key on a hook in the bedroom by the back door.

A free-standing clothes airer is provided for drying small items. For larger items, use the washing lines beneath the car port. These lines are particularly useful for drying or airing your beach towels when you return from the beach.

The ironing board, iron, vacuum cleaner and other cleaning tools or products are typically located in the utility room or under the kitchen sink.

## Bin collections

The **green bin** is for general household waste, which is collected every Tuesday and Saturday. All waste must be in tied bags.

The **black bin** with the yellow lid is for recycling and is collected every 2 weeks on a
Saturday afternoon. The Summer dates for 2023 are as follows: 

- 8th July
- 22nd July
- 5th August
- 19th August
- 2nd September

Note that the recycling bin must not be used for glass, which should be taken to a community bin. (You are likely to pass several dedicated glass bins around the streets of Sauvian.)

Please put the bins outside the front of the property for collection and bring them back in after they have been emptied. 

All bins must be empty on departure and you must dispose of any left-over bags that cannot be collected by using any community bins in the area. For more information about the location of these bins, see [Community bins](localamenities.md#commmunity-bins). 

**Note:** The property management company will charge for any bins that are left unemptied.


## Household appliances

If you have any problems operating any of the household appliances, the instruction
booklets can be found in the bottom drawer of the cabinet in the dining area.

The LG fridge freezer features a water storage tank in the fridge door rather than a mains
water connection. This means that you can choose to fill the tank with tap or mineral water,
which is then used for the cold water, ice, and crushed ice supply.


## Windy days

The Languedoc is the windiest region of France. In the peak season, the wind is very welcome to take the edge off the heat. However, on very windy days, we can experience a wind tunnel effect through the house if the doors or windows are open at the back and the front of the house  simultaneously. The doors are prone to slam shut, which might cause injury, so please take
care. During high winds, we recommend keeping the back doors and windows closed, and
closing the internal door to the green bedroom before opening the external door to the back of the property.

## Sun shades

An automatic awning is available to shade the outdoor dining table. 

A triangular sail shade is also stored in the garage and can be set up between the car port and external wall to provide additional shade on the terrace. See the picture on the [Welcome page](index.md).

During high winds, please do not use either shade. 

## Fuse box

The fuse box is located in the garage. Spare fuses can be found in the corner cupboard in
the lounge, together with spare light bulbs, should they be needed.

## Bicycles

There are a couple of bicycles in the garage that you are free to use at your own risk to get
about locally. All we ask is that you lock them up when you take them out and repair any punctures so that our next guests can make use of them too. A puncture repair kit is located in the top drawer of the cabinet in the dining area.

## Cot and highchair

If you have asked to use the travel cot, you can find a spare set of linen in the cupboard of the grey bedroom. If you need to use this set during your stay, please launder the ones you change and return these to the cupboard.

A booster seat for small children to use at the table can be found in the cabinet in the dining area. 

## Television

The television is a smart television, with the usual selection of applications such as Netflix. 
An Amazon Fire Stick is also provided for accessing additional services. Terrestrial French television channels are also available.

**English channels**: The Humax box provides access to English television channels. However, Humax cannot receive high definition (HD) channels in France. Whilst some non-HD channels are available, the Amazon Fire Stick can be used to reach services such as BBC iPlayer, ITVX, More4, and Channel 5. Before connecting to these services, start the **NordVPN** application on the Fire stick and connect to a UK server. Then start the service you want to watch.    

Please do not alter the position or angle of the television to avoid excessive stress on the
wall fixings.
