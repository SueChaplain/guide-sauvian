#Before you leave  

Please ... 

- Throw away all perishable foodstuffs and empty the bins. Dispose of any bin bags, recycling, or glass in the [Community bins](localamenities.md#community-bins), leaving the property bins empty.
- Wash up or leave the dishwasher running.
- Leave the bedding on the beds and hang up the towels in the bathroom.
- If you have used the oven or air fryer, please ensure that they are clean.
- If you have used the BBQ, please clean the grill and dispose of any ash.
- Try to leave the villa as clean as possible. Although cleaning is included as part of the
rental contract, any deep cleaning that is necessary as a result of neglect will incur an
extra charge, which may be deducted from your deposit.
- Close the security blinds in the lounge and lock all the doors before returning all the
keys to the key box. Please spin the dial when you close the box to secure the code.
- Ensure that the pool safety fence is in place for our next guests.
- Ensure that the bins are inside the gate.
- Slide the gate closed behind you.

Thank you for staying at our villa â€“ we hope you enjoyed your holiday. Have a safe journey!
